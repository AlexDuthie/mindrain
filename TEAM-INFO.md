## Team Weaknesses

### Andrew Weaknesses

* Usually do work later on in the day rather than early on
* Sometimes zone out during meetings
* Not the best with the IBM Services yet

### Scott Weaknesses

* Late starter (mornings, crohns in the morning is brutal on me, need meds to kick in xD)
* Girlfriend is distracting (pregnancy)
* Tend to repeat my self sometimes
* Can become frustrated as feeling of time-is-precious
* Can be loud

### Alex Weaknesses

* May be un-available during my 'availability' due to family life
* Work on stuff at very late times when most people sleep!
* Back-End Development (Need WAY more knowledge)
* Distracted during the day a bit due to my Wife and Children being in the same room as my 'study space'

### Jason Weaknesses

* Easily sidetracked
* Talks to much

### Marcin Weaknesses

* Late starter (My brain seems to turn on in the afternoon)
* Sometimes I overthink and over complicate things.
* Can become frustrated if sitting at one code block for more than 2 hours trying to make the code work.
* Whenever I code I lose time of track and 2 hours can turn into 8 hours.
* Can get distracted quiet easily.
