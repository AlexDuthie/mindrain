### Daily Alignments
---

* Attend **Daily** alignments unless:
    * you have a valid reason to not join (let the team know at least an hour before if possible)
* Prepare for the Alignment Meetings with:
    * evidence of learning activity/ contribution to project (daily project time is 4 hours a day)
* Meetings should not stray off topic, stay on point!
    * be attentive during the meeting
    * be communicative/ Valid Input

### Slack
---

* Keep slack relevant to project talk
* Update the team on slack on what you are doing (throughout the day)

### Jira
---

* If you are watching a tutorial, add it to Jira
* If you are doing a course, add it to Jira
* If you are working on the app and it isn't on Jira, add it to Jira (try to break it down)
* Be descriptive on your tickets
* Use the comment system to keep everyone updated
* Check Jira everyday/ Check Jira Channel for updates

### Repository
---

* Pull Repository Daily (Mandatory)
* Daily Commits during Development
    * Break down your commits, don't add 10 changes into one commit

## Strike Guidelines

* Majority of the team vote if a strike is needed
* First strike will result in a team meeting to explain why the strike was issued
* Two strikes will result in a team meeting to have a discussion on how to solve any issues
* Three strikes will result in being fowarded to Tom and Douglas
* Strikes will reset to 0 if the issue is turned around within the week

### What could cause concerns?

> Keep the code of conduct in mind

* If a member of the team fail to comply to the code of conduct
* If a member of the team is failing to communicate (2-3 days)
* If a member is simply not contributing (2 days max), via:
    * Jira
    * Repo
    * Slack
    * Daily Logs
    * Alignments
    * Attentiveness
    
```
Every effort to prevent a strike will be made before any voting.

Failing to comply will mostly prompt a discussion, hopefully we won't need to strike anyone! xD
